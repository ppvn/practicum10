I am purple, yellow, red,
and green.
The King cannot reach me and neither can the Queen.
I show my colours after the rain,
And only when the sun comes out again.
What is it?
Red and green and delicate blue,
Orange, yellow, and violet, too.
Indigo's there,
a deep, dark, hue.
I see, but can't touch it, and
neither can you!
What is it?
